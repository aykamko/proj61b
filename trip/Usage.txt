Usage:

        java -ea trip.Main [ -m MAP ] [ -o OUT ] [ REQUEST ]
    where MAP (default Map) contains the map data, OUT (default standard
    output) takes the result, and REQUEST (default standard input) contains
    the locations along the requested trip.

    Trip computes the shortest path between each location in REQUEST, and
    outputs the path in a clean, collapsed format.
